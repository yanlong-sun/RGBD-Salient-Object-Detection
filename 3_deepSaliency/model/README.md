Models can be found in [google drive](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0By55MQnF3PHCbFpocU5jOTdVOHM&usp=sharing)

For a demo or practical purpose, the model `train_iter_40000.caffemodel` used in the `demo.ipynb` is fine.

To reproduce all the results in the paper, we will upload all the models used in the experiments (trained on different datasets).
