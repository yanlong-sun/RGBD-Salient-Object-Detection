Step 1 (Obtain the dataset): Unzip the 'LFSD.zip' and 'NJU2K.zip' files in the 'Dataset' folder to obtain the dataset.
Step 2 (Calculate the depth saliency map): Open the 'acsdSaliency.sln' file in the '1_acsdSaliency' folder, modify the name of the dataset (LFSD or NJU2K) to be processed in 'demo.cpp', and then compile.
Step 3 (Fuse the depth saliency map): Open the 'Process_org_image.m' file in the '2_Pre-Processing' folder, modify the name of the dataset (LFSD or NJU2K), and then compile.
Step 4 (Compute the initial saliency map using the multi-task FCN): In the Ubuntu system (with the Caffe environment configured), open the terminal in the '3_deepSaliency' folder, modify the name of the dataset (LFSD or NJU2K) to be processed in the 'demo.py' file, and then run 'python demo.py' in the Caffe environment.
Step 5 (Refine the saliency map): Open the 'Runme_forBLsaliencymap.m' file in the '4_Refinement' folder, modify the name of the dataset (LFSD or NJU2K), and then compile. The final saliency map is stored in '../SaliencyMap/LFSD/Ours' and '../SaliencyMap/NJU2K/Ours'.
Step 6 (Objective evaluation): Open the 'evaluate_models.m' file in the '../5_Evaluation/tools/' folder, run the program, select the model and dataset to be evaluated, and the results are stored in '../5_Evaluation/Results/'.
